# FoodFindr

## Introduction
FoodFindr is an app that aims to recommend good hawker food around the user. Many good hawker stalls might not recieve the same rave that trendier restaurants or cafes see due to social media, with a potential reason being the fact that they do not have a good online presence. Some stalls do not even have available menus online, making it even harder for online recognition.
